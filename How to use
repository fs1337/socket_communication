There are two processes in my project, we use socket to send and receive the characters got from the input. 
Just for convenience, I use my own computer to create two sockets.
Executing steps for client.c:
1 open one terminal, run: “gcc client.c –o client.out”
2 execute the object file for client.c: “./client.out 127.0.0.1”
Notes: for the second step, please regard the first argument as your server’s ip address.
Executing steps for server.c:
1 open the other terminal or open a terminal on the other computer, run: “gcc server.c -o server.out”
