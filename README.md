# socket_communication

Modify the program described in Assignment 3 in such a way that 
the two programs can be run on different machines. 
The program receiver.c will now be the client program that will interact with the user. 
Call it client.c. 
The processor.c will be the backend program â€“ call it server.c. 
The client and server programs have the same functionality as described in Assignment 3 except that
they should use sockets as a communication mechanism that will allow the client and the server to be run 
on different machines.
